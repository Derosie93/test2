        <h4>1: Play Golf</h4>
        <p>
          I started to play golf about 5 months ago, it all started out with my
          friends wanted me to come with them and all the sudden i was stuck and
          i love it!
        </p>
        <h4>2: Train my dog</h4>
        <p>
          Me and my wife is a owner to a bordercollie, that is abit older then
          two years old.
        </p>
        <h4>3: Running</h4>
        <p>
          Me and a friend made a bet to see who can reach ten swedish mile
          first, and that got me more in to running and now i enjoy it.
        </p>
        <h4>4: Play video games</h4>
        <p>
          I've played video games my whole life, so thats something i enjoy to
          do and to just let go of everthing that is around you, and to be in
          the zone by yourself for a while.
        </p>
        <h4>5: Travel!</h4>
        <p>
          Me and my wife are both interested in traveling, so when we have the
          chance no matter if its far or not, then we will just pack our bags
          and go and spend som quality time together.
